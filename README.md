# acl_report

Based on the original work of [Aaron Addleman](https://aaronaddleman.com/articles/redhat-linux-acl-report-bash-shell-script/)

Takes two arguments: the path to start looking for directories and the file name for the report.   
Builds a header with date and time of report.   
Finds the users and groups and counts the amount of times they appear in the report for a summary.   
Appends the full report of all the files with the ACL.
